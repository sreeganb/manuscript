abstract = {Abstract The calculation of free-energy differences is one of the main challenges in computational biology and biochemistry. Umbrella sampling, biased molecular dynamics (MD), is one of the methods that provide free energy along a reaction coordinate. Here, the method is derived in a historic overview and is compared with related methods like thermodynamic integration, slow growth, steered MD, or the Jarzynski-based fast-growth technique. In umbrella sampling, bias potentials along a (one- or more-dimensional) reaction coordinate drive a system from one thermodynamic state to another (e.g., reactant and product). The intermediate steps are covered by a series of windows, at each of which an MD simulation is performed. The bias potentials can have any functional form. Often, harmonic potentials are used for their simplicity. From the sampled distribution of the system along the reaction coordinate, the change in free energy in each window can be calculated. The windows are then combined by methods like the weighted histogram analysis method or umbrella integration. If the bias potential is adapted to result in an even distribution between the end states, then this whole range can be spanned by one window (adaptive-bias umbrella sampling). In this case, the free-energy change is directly obtained from the bias. The sampling in each window can be improved by replica exchange methods; either by exchange between successive windows or by running additional simulations at higher temperatures. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract Metadynamics is a powerful technique for enhancing sampling in molecular dynamics simulations and reconstructing the free-energy surface as a function of few selected degrees of freedom, often referred to as collective variables (CVs). In metadynamics, sampling is accelerated by a history-dependent bias potential, which is adaptively constructed in the space of the CVs. Since its first appearance, significant improvements have been made to the original algorithm, leading to an efficient, flexible, and accurate method that has found many successful applications in several domains of science. Here, we discuss first the theory underlying metadynamics and its recent developments. In particular, we focus on the crucial issue of choosing an appropriate set of CVs and on the possible strategies to alleviate this difficulty. Later in the second part, we present a few recent representative applications, which we have classified into three main classes: solid-state physics, chemical reactions, and biomolecules. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) is a highly versatile and widely used molecular simulation program. It has been developed over the last three decades with a primary focus on molecules of biological interest, including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule ligands, as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane environments. For the study of such systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools that include numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free energy estimators, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis techniques, and model-building capabilities. The CHARMM program is applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many-particle systems. Calculations with CHARMM can be performed using a number of different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical force fields, to all-atom classical potential energy functions with explicit solvent and various boundary conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models. The program has been ported to numerous platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This article provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis on developments since the publication of the original CHARMM article in 1983. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.J Comput Chem, 2009.},

Computational correlation of experimental values with chemical models permits three-dimensional geometric and electrostatic assignment of transition states formed at enzymatic catalytic sites. The combination of experimental and computational access to transition-state information permits (a) the design of transition-state analogs as powerful enzymatic inhibitors, (b) exploration of protein features linked to transition-state structure, (c) analysis of ensemble atomic motions involved in achieving the transition state, (d) transition-state lifetimes, and (e) separation of ground-state (Michaelis complexes) from transition-state effects. Transition-state analogs with picomolar dissociation constants have been achieved for several enzymatic targets. Transition states of closely related isozymes indicate that the protein's dynamic architecture is linked to transition-state structure. Fast dynamic motions in catalytic sites are linked to transition-state generation. Enzymatic transition states have lifetimes of femtoseconds, the lifetime of bond vibrations. Binding isotope effects (BIEs) reveal relative reactant and transition-state analog binding distortion for comparison with actual transition states. }

abstract = { All chemical transformations pass through an unstable structure called the transition state, which is poised between the chemical structures of the substrates and products. The transition states for chemical reactions are proposed to have lifetimes near 10−13 sec, the time for a single bond vibration. No physical or spectroscopic method is available to directly observe the structure of the transition state for enzymatic reactions. Yet transition state structure is central to understanding catalysis, because enzymes function by lowering activation energy. An accepted view of enzymatic catalysis is tight binding to the unstable transition state structure. Transition state mimics bind tightly to enzymes by capturing a fraction of the binding energy for the transition state species. The identification of numerous transition state inhibitors supports the transition state stabilization hypothesis for enzymatic catalysis. Advances in methods for measuring and interpreting kinetic isotope effects and advances in computational chemistry have provided an experimental route to understand transition state structure. Systematic analysis of intrinsic kinetic isotope effects provides geometric and electronic structure for enzyme-bound transition states. This information has been used to compare transition states for chemical and enzymatic reactions; determine whether enzymatic activators alter transition state structure; design transition state inhibitors; and provide the basis for predicting the affinity of enzymatic inhibitors. Enzymatic transition states provide an understanding of catalysis and permit the design of transition state inhibitors. This article reviews transition state theory for enzymatic reactions. Selected examples of enzymatic transition states are compared to the respective transition state inhibitors. }

abstract = {Directed evolution is a widely-used engineering strategy for improving the stabilities or biochemical functions of proteins by repeated rounds of mutation and selection. These experiments offer empirical lessons about how proteins evolve in the face of clearly-defined laboratory selection pressures. Directed evolution has revealed that single amino acid mutations can enhance properties such as catalytic activity or stability and that adaptation can often occur through pathways consisting of sequential beneficial mutations. When there are no single mutations that improve a particular protein property experiments always find a wealth of mutations that are neutral with respect to the laboratory-defined measure of fitness. These neutral mutations can open new adaptive pathways by at least 2 different mechanisms. Functionally-neutral mutations can enhance a protein's stability, thereby increasing its tolerance for subsequent functionally beneficial but destabilizing mutations. They can also lead to changes in “promiscuous” functions that are not currently under selective pressure, but can subsequently become the starting points for the adaptive evolution of new functions. These lessons about the coupling between adaptive and neutral protein evolution in the laboratory offer insight into the evolution of proteins in nature.}

The PDDG/PM3 results for heats of formation also show substantial improvement over density functional theory with large basis sets. The PDDG modifications consist of a single function, which is added to the existing pairwise core repulsion functions within PM3 and MNDO, a reparameterized semiempirical parameter set, and modified computation of the energy of formation of a gaseous atom. The PDDG addition introduces functional group information via pairwise atomic interactions using only atom-based parameters. For 622 diverse molecules containing C, H, N, and O atoms, mean absolute errors in calculated heats of formation are reduced from 4.4 to 3.2 kcal/mol and from 8.4 to 5.2 kcal/mol using the PDDG modified versions of PM3 and MNDO over the standard versions, respectively. Several specific problems are overcome, including the relative stability of hydrocarbon isomers, and energetics of small rings and molecules containing multiple heteroatoms. The internal consistency of PDDG energies is also significantly improved, enabling more reliable analysis of isomerization energies and trends across series of molecules; PDDG isomerization energies show significant improvement over B3LYP/6-31G* results. Comparison of heats of formation, ionization potentials, dipole moments, isomer, and conformer energetics, intermolecular interaction energies, activation energies, and molecular geometries from the PDDG techniques is made to experimental data and values from other semiempirical and ab initio methods. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
