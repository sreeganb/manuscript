\begin{abstract}
  Transition path sampling (TPS) has been widely applied for the
  calculations of reaction rate, transition state and reaction 
  coordinates of condensed phase systems. Here, we discuss a scheme 
  for the calculation of free energies with the TPS method in combination 
  with a window based sampling technique. This 
  distribution can then be used for the calculations of free energies
  using standard Boltzmann inversion schemes. We calculate the free
  energy profiles of the reactions catalyzed by the human methionine 
  S-adenosyltransferase (MAT2A) enzyme and the plasmodium 
  vivax adenosine deaminase enzyme to demonstrate the applicability of this 
  method.

\section{Introduction}
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are increasingly being
used to calculate quantitative estimations of experimentally measurable 
kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of enzyme catalyzed reactions. 
\cite{Karplus02NatStructMolBiol9p646,
Schramm98AnnuRevBiochem67p693,Zhang05AccChemRes38p379,
Schramm11AnnuRevBiochem80p703,Schramm18ChemRev118p11194} 
This has helped in proposing mechanisms and explanations for 
enzyme activity, fast high throughput screening of thousands of inhibitor 
molecues in drug lead discovery, \cite{Jorgensen09AccChemRes42p724,Sliwoski14PharmacolRev66p334} 
directed evolution for designing enzymes with enhanced catalytic 
activities, \cite{Thyme09Nature461p1300,Bloom09PNAS106p9995,Schafer19JAmChemSoc141p10431} etc.    
Straightforward MD simulations adequately sample 
the long-lived stable reactant and product states 
but the high energy barrier-crossing events that occur rarely and at long 
time scales are not easily accessible using this method alone.
To access such states at a higher frequency using MD simulations 
several enhanced sampling techniques 
have been developed in the past few decades some of which are 
umbrella sampling, \cite{Kastner11WileyInterdiscipRevComputMolSci1p932} 
metadynamics, \cite{Barducci11WileyInterdiscipRevComputMolSci1p826}
steered MD, \cite{Park04JChemPhys120p5946}
milestoning, \cite{Faradjian04JChemPhys120p10880} and transition path sampling 
(TPS). \cite{Pratt86JChemPhys85p5045,Bolhuis02AnnRevPhysChem53p291,
Dellago98JChemPhys108p1964,Bolhuis21AdvTheory4p2000237}

TPS in particular is an attractive method since it samples reactive trajectories
in which the rare barrier-crossing events are guaranteed to occur and
it does not require a priori knowledge of the reaction coordinate which can be 
complex for large biological systems.
TPS is based on the Monte Carlo importance sampling in the 
space of trajectories. It uses the shooting and shifting algorithm 
to collect an ensemble of reactive pathways that are real dynamical 
trajectories generated without the application of any bias forces. \cite{dellago02AdvChemPhys123} 
Therefore the TPS ensemble can be used to obtain 
kinetic information such as the rate of the reaction as well as to elucidate 
the transition state, reaction coordinate and the reaction mechanism. 
TPS has been successfully applied to study problems such as enzyme catalysis, 
\cite{Antoniou01JPhysChemB105p5553,Hay12NatChem4p161,Schwartz09NatChemBiol5p551} 
protein folding, \cite{Bolhuis03ProcNatlAcadSci100p12129,Juraszek12ChemPhys396p30} etc. 

Calculating equilibrium properties such as the free energy of an enzymatic 
catalysis reaction within TPS is not straighforward. 
The Monte Carlo algorithm used in TPS has an acceptance criterion that 
is only satisfied if the trajectory begins in the reactant basin and ends in 
the product basin or vice versa, hence trajectories that are localized in the 
reactant or product basins are rejected. The localized trajectories contribute
to the probability density distribution function ($P(\lambda)$) which is the 
probability of a system at equilibrium to have a particular value of the 
order parameter $\lambda$. \cite{Dellago09AdvCompSimAppp167} 

Frenkel has shown that inclusion of rejected states in Markov state Monte 
Carlo algorith can help speed up the convergence of the calculations of 
order-parameter distribution of a two-dimensional
Ising model. \cite{Frenkel04ProcNatAcadSci101p17571}
Inclusion of rejected trajectories within TPS was first discussed by Radhakrishnan 
et al. \cite{Radhakrishnan04JChemPhys121p2436} who developed `BOLAS' which combines 
the shooting and shifting algorithms of TPS with a window based sampling technique 
in the spirit of umbrella sampling to calculate equilibrium free energy 
differences. Peters et al. used a variant of the BOLAS scheme called the 
equilibrium path sampling (EPS) where they use aimless shooting 
combined with window based sampling for free energy calculations. 
\cite{Peters08JAmChemSoc130p17342,Beckham10epsbook} 
More recently Brotzakis et al., \cite{Brotzakis19JChemPhys151p174111}
have developed a reweighted path ensemble scheme within the standard TPS method 
called virtual interface exchange TPS (VIE-TPS) to calculate the free energy 
landscape. VIE-TPS is shown to produce reasonably accurate free energy profiles for 
chemical reactions that are diffusive in nature whereas it is less accurate otherwise.
Transition interface sampling (TIS) has been used to obtain 
reweighted path ensemble which can give access to free energy 
and committor surfaces. \cite{Rogal10JChemPhys17p174109}

Free energy calculations based on the TPS shooting algorithm is 
appealing but rare in the literature. Applications of this 
method to study enzymatic reactions and comparisons of the calculated 
free energies to experimental measurements can shine light on the 
accuracy of this approach compared to the standard methods used for 
free energy calculations.    
In this manuscript we implement and apply the 
algorithm developed by Radhakrishnan et al. \cite{Radhakrishnan04JChemPhys121p2436} 
to calculate the free energies of reactions catalyzed by two systems:
the human MAT2A enzyme and the plasmodium vivax adenosine deaminase 
enzyme. \cite{Luo07JAmChemSoc129p8008,Ho09Biochemistry48p9618}
Human MAT2A catalyzes the formation of S-adenosyl L-methionine (SAM).
SAM is an essential metabolite which is 
distributed to almost all body tissues and fluids, is an universal 
methyl donor and is of fundamental importance to the metabolism of 
compounds such as hormones, neureotransmitters, proteins, 
and nucleic acids. \cite{Friedel89Drugs38p389}
plasmodium vivax is a parasite that is responsible for the most number 
of cases of malaria globally. Targeting proteins that are essential to
the metabolism of this bacteria such as the adenosine deaminase enzyme 
is a good anti-malarial drug development strategy. \cite{Madrid08JBiolChem283p35899} 
These enzymes were chosen not only because of their importance in 
biochemical applications but also because of the availability of experimental 
results with which comparisons can be drawn. This manuscript is organized as 
follows: first we discuss the TPS method and the algorithm that we use 
to calculate the free energies briefly, then we show calculations which apply this 
method on the two enzymatic reactions. Finally we compare our results to expeiments
and provide conclusions. 
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\section{Methods}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\subsection{Transition path sampling}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Here we briefly describe the equations describing the TPS method for the purpose of
introducing notations as well as for the sake of being complete. 
Consider the molecular dynamics simulation of a molecular system consisting 
of $N$ atoms. Starting from the initial positions and momenta of each atom at time $t_0$,
the time evolution is carried out by finding the position ($\textbf{q}$) and 
momenta ($\textbf{p}$) of each atom at regular intervals of time $t_i = t_0 + i\Delta t$  
($i = 0,1,2,\ldots$). At each of the time slices, the positions and 
momenta can be collectively represented as
the set $z = \{\textbf{q},\textbf{p}\}$. If the MD simulation is 
run for a total 
time of $\mathcal{T}$ the number of time slices is given by 
$L = \mathcal{T}/\Delta t +1$ and for this sequence of 
times the state of the system can be represented as 
\begin{equation}
z(\mathcal{T}) = \{z_0, z_{\Delta t}, z_{2\Delta t},\ldots,z_{\mathcal{T}}\}
\end{equation}
The probability to obtain a particular sequence of states is determined by the initial 
conditions and the type of dynamics used for the time evolution. If the time evolution is 
Markovian, the probability to go from $z_{i\Delta t}$ to $z_{(i+1)\Delta t}$ depends only 
on $z_{i\Delta t}$ and not on conditions before the time $i\Delta t$ the total path probablility can 
be expressed as the product of individual probabilities $p(i\rightarrow j)$ as 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}[z(\mathcal{T})] = \rho(z_0)\Pi_{i=0}^{\mathcal{T}/\Delta t-1} p(z_{i\Delta t}\rightarrow z_{(i+1)\Delta t}),
\end{equation}
where $\rho(z_0)$ is the equilibrium distribution of the initial conditions and for a canonical ensemble this can be 
expressed as 
\begin{equation}
\rho(z_0) = \exp(-\beta H(z_0))/Z
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
Z = \int dz \exp(-\beta H(z)) 
\end{equation}
is the canonical partition function. 

Within the transition path sampling, the trajectories of interest start in the reactant region of the 
phase space ($\mathcal{A}$) and end in the product region ($\mathcal{B}$). Such reactive trajectories have 
a restricted probability distribution function given by
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{AB}}[z_{\mathcal{T}}] = h_{\mathcal{A}}(z_0)\mathcal{P}[z(\mathcal{T})]
h_{\mathcal{B}}(z_{\mathcal{T}})/Z_{\mathcal{AB}}(\mathcal{T})\label{eqn:tpsensem}
\end{equation}
where 
\[
    h_{\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{B}}(z)= 
\begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if } z\in \mathcal{A}/\mathcal{B}\\
    0,              & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
The set of all reactive trajectories characterized by the distribution function
given by Eq. \ref{eqn:tpsensem} is the transition path ensemble. 

\subsection{Equilibrium distribution of order parameters}
The free energy as a function of the order parameter $\zeta$ is defined
as 
\begin{equation}
\text{A}(\zeta) = -k_{\text{B}}T\text{ln}(P(\zeta)) + C, \label{eqn:fenergy}
\end{equation}
where $P(\zeta)$ is the probability distribution of the reaction coordinate
$\zeta$ and $C$ is an arbitrary constant. At equilibrium the probability distribution of the 
reaction coordinate 
can be obtained from the distribution function for the phase space $\rho(\textbf{q})$ as
\begin{equation}
P(\zeta) = \int d\textbf{V} \rho(\textbf{q})\delta\left[\zeta-\tilde{\zeta}(\textbf{q})\right].
\end{equation}
The integration is over the entire phase space. In practice the calculation of this distribution function
often proceeds using histogram based methods where the reaction coordinate is 
divided into bins and the frequency of the occurence of the reaction coordinate within a particular window
during the course of molecular dynamics simulations is used to calculate the probability distribution. 
Since some values of the reaction coordinates particulary close to the transition state are 
rarely sampled in a conventional MD simulations, enhanced sampling techniques such as the umbrella sampling
are necessary to sample the low probability regions. TPS is designed to sample these regions in phase space 
without the application of any external bias, but the trajectories sampled with TPS are only reactive and hence
they are not distributed according to the equilibrium distribution function. 
The restriction that the pathways start from the reactant state and end in the product state can be relaxed
to obtain an ensemble of trajectories that will be distributed according to the equilibrium distribution. 
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\subsection{Algorithm for free energy calculations}\label{ssec:algorithm}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
We follow the steps proposed by Radhakrishnan et al. \cite{Radhakrishnan04JChemPhys121p2436} 
to sample TPS trajectories within windows of the order parameter. 
\begin{itemize}
\item An appropriate order parameter is chosen for the reaction of interest 
that can distinguish the reactant and product states sufficiently well and the TPS ensemble is harvested 
which consists only of reactive trajectories.
\item Divide the order parameter into windows $\{\zeta_i\}$ within which the 
order parameters are given by 
$\zeta_{i}^{min} < \zeta < \zeta_{i}^{max}$.
\item Choose a reactive trajectory $\tilde{z}(\mathcal{T})$ from the TPS ensemble as 
a guiding trajectory for the window sampling. Pick a time slice from this trajectory 
$\tilde{z}_{j\Delta t}$ such that the order parameter calculated for this time slice
$\tilde{\zeta}$ satisfies $\zeta_{i}^{min} < \tilde{\zeta} < \zeta_{i}^{max}$.
\item Using the shooting and shifting algorithm familiar from TPS simulations, \cite{dellago02AdvChemPhys123}
harvest dynamics trajectories starting from the time slice $\tilde{z}_{j\Delta t}$ of the trajectory 
$\tilde{z}(\mathcal{T})$ and accept the new trajectory if at any time slice the calculated 
order parameter $\hat{\zeta}$ satisfies $\zeta_{i}^{min} < \hat{\zeta} < \zeta_{i}^{max}$.
\item Calculate the probability distribution ($P_i(\zeta)$) within the window $\zeta_{i}^{min} 
< \zeta < \zeta_{i}^{max}$ by constructing histograms obtained from the ensemble of 
accepted trajectories for the window $i$. 
\item Combine the probability distributions in successive windows by adjusting the constants $C$
such that the free energy $A$ from Eq. \ref{eqn:fenergy} is continuous. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Computational details}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\subsection{System preparation}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We used the crystal structure of the human MAT2A enzyme 
bound to methylthioadenosine and di-imido triphosphate (PNPNP)
(protein data bank ID: 7L1A) reported by Niland 
et al. \cite{Niland21Biochem60p791,Ghosh21JAmChemSoc143p18325} and the crystal 
structure of \textit{pv}ADA in complex with MT-coformycin (protein data bank ID: 3EWC) 
reported by Ho et al. \cite{Ho09Biochemistry48p9618} as the starting points of our two 
simulations. For calculations involving the MAT2A enzyme the substrates were modified to 
L-methionine and adenosyl triphosphate (ATP) whereas for calculations with the \textit{pv}ADA
enzyme the substrates were modified to $2^{'}-$deoxyadenosine and hydroxide ion. 
We solvated both the systems using TIP3P water molecules \cite{Jorgensen83JChemPhys79p926}
in a nanodroplet sphere whose volume was fixed at $15$ {\AA}
away from the protein's surface and the total charge was neutralized 
using potassium ions. 

MD simulations within classical and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics 
(QMMM) approximations were carried out using the CHARMM program 
package. \cite{Brooks83JComputChem4p187} 
For the MM calculations the CHARMM36 force field \cite{Brooks09JComputChem30p1545} 
was used and for the QM calculations the approximate PM3 semiempirical 
method \cite{Repasky02JComputChem23p1601} was used. 
For the hybrid QMMM simulations, the MAT2A system was partitioned into a QM
region consisting of the ATP and MET molecules along with three Mg$^{2+}$ ions 
and the MM region consists of the rest of the molecules. 
For the $pv$ADA system the QM region consisted of 
the adenosine molecule, an hydroxide anion, Zn$^{2+}$ ion and 
a portion of the Glu229 residue which was partitioned within the generalized 
hybrid orbital (GHO) scheme. \cite{Gao98JPhysChemA102p4714}  

The energies of both the systems were minimized using 50 steps of the 
steepest descent method, followed by 2000 steps of the
adopted basis Newton-Raphson method where only classical molecular mechanics 
was used for the dynamics. 
The minimized systems were
heated slowly to 300 K for 35 ps beginning with harmonic
constraints on all atoms except on the H atoms and the TIP3P 
water molecules with gradual reduction of the restraint forces to 1. 
15 ps of equilibration was carried out starting with harmonic 
constraints of force constant 1 followed by 20 ps of contraint free 
equilibration to prepare the systems for TPS simulations. 
During the heating and equilibration steps, bonds that contain 
hydrogen atoms in the MM region were restrained to their equilibrium values 
using the SHAKE procedure. \cite{Ryckaert77JComputPhys23p327} 
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\subsection{Transition path sampling}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TPS simulations require the definition of unique reactant and product states
to collect reactive trajectories based on the Monte Carlo algorithm. Here we 
discuss the details of the reactions involving the MAT2A and the $pv$ADA enzymes 
to identify and define the order parameters characterizing the reactant and product basins.  

The reaction catalyzed by the human MAT2A enzyme is
between adenosyl $5'$-triphosphate (ATP) and L-methionine (MET) molecules resulting in the formation of
S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) which is depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:mat2a-reaction}.
 This reaction was experimentally characterized by 
Firestone et al. \cite{Firestone17JAmChemSoc139p13754} to follow a S$_{\text{N}}2$ transition 
state. The key bond parameters for this reaction consists of the distance between the
nucleophilic sulfur atom of MET and the $5'-C$ atom of the ATP (denoted as $dis(SC)$), and the distance between 
oxygen atom of the phosphate group and the $5'-C$ atom of ATP ($dis(OC)$).
For the TPS calculations we define the reactant state to have $dis(OC)$ to be 
less than 1.7 {\AA} and the product state to have the $dis(SC)$ less than 1.7 {\AA}. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/mat2a-reaction.png}
\caption{The reaction catalyzed by human MAT2A enzyme}
\label{fig:mat2a-reaction}
\end{figure}

$pv$ADA catalyzes the reaction between adenosine and hydroxide ion 
resulting in the formation of inosine and ammonia as shown in
Fig. \ref{fig:ada-reaction}.
$pv$ADA is an essential enzyme in the purine salvage pathway and 
inhibiting this enzyme is a promising approach to treat malaria.   
This reaction proceeds with the nucleophilic O atom (O$^{\text{hydroxyl}}$) of the hydroxide anion
attacking the electrophilic C6 atom of the adenosyl ring leading to the formation of a Meisenheimer 
complex while the N1 atom on the adenosyl ring starts to get 
protonated by the Glu229 residue of $pv$ADA. At the transition state, experimental findings 
suggest that the dissociation of the C6$-$N6 bond as well as the protonation of the N1 
atom are almost complete. \cite{Luo07JAmChemSoc129p8008} The key bond parameters are 
the distance between the approaching hydroxyl oxygen and the C6 atom (denoted as $dis(OC)$) and the 
dissociating C6$-$N6 ($dis(NC)$) bond distance. For the TPS simulaions we define the reactant state to 
have $dis(NC)$ being less than $1.7$ {\AA} and the product state to have the 
$dis(OC)$ less than $1.7$ {\AA}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/ada-new.png}
\caption{The reaction catalyzed by adenosine deaminase enzyme}
\label{fig:ada-reaction}
\end{figure}

A biased initial reactive trajectory is obtained by using harmonic restraint forces 
of 1500 to break the $O-C$ bond and form the $S-C$ bond for the MAT2A enzyme and 
to break the $N-C$ bond and form the $O-C$ bond for the case of the $pv$ADA enzyme. 
Using the biased trajectory as the starting point and after removing the restraint 
forces, the shooting algorithm was used to generate
new trajectories. The well known shooting algorithm begins with the choice of a 
random time slice from the biased reactive trajectory and perturbing the momenta of the system.
Then the dynamics is propagated for 250 steps forawards and backwards using $1\;fs$ time steps
resulting in a trajectory with a time period of $0.5\;ps$.
A total of 150 and 130 reactive trajectories were generated for the MAT2A and $pv$ADA
enzymes, respectively. 
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\subsection{Free energy calculations}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
To obtain the free energy profile along the order parameter, we use the method 
discussed in sec. \ref{ssec:algorithm}. The order paratemer for the MAT2A system 
is defined to be $dis(OC)-dis(SC)$ and that for the $pv$ADA is defined as 
$dis(NC)-dis(OC)$. For the MAT2A system, configurations are sampled within 
the range $[-2.0,2.0]$ and this range is divided into 14 overlapping windows 
($0.09$ {\AA} overlap on either side). 
Configurations are sampled for the $pv$ADA system within the interval $[-3.0, 3.0]$ {\AA}
of the order parameter value which is divided into 20 overlapping 
windows ($0.045$ {\AA} between neighboring windows). A reactive 
trajectory from the TPS ensemble is chosen to be the guide trajectory 
for sampling within each of the windows. To sample in a particular window $w$, a 
frame from this reactive trajectory is chosen such that the value of its 
order parameter falls within $w$. Using the shooting algorithm
the momenta are perturbed and dynamics is run for 10 steps forwards and backwards with a 
$1\;fs$ time step to obtain a trajectory with a time period of $20\;fs$.    
Within each window 3000 TPS trajectories are collected. The 
probability distribution function for the order parameter within window $w$ 
is then calculated as normalized histograms which represent the populations 
of the configurations within the window at equilibrium. 
Then we calculate the free energy profile in a similar fashion to the WHAM 
procedure \cite{Kumar92JComputChem13p1011} which is generally used to obtain the 
potential of mean force from umbrella sampling calculations.

\section{Results and discussion}

\subsection{Human Methionine Adenosyltransferase 2A}
The equilibrated structure of the MAT2A enzyme in complex with 
ATP, MET and two Mg$^{2+}$ ions is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:mat2a-equil}.
\begin{figure}[ht!]

\label{fig:mat2a-equil}
\end{figure}
In the binding pocket the adenosyl moiety and the Phe250 and Ile117 residues 
are found to have $\pi-\pi$ interactions stabilizing the molecule. The triphosphate 
moiety forms hydrogen bonds with ... residues.

\caption{Bond breaking ($dis(OC)$), bond forming ($dis(SC)$) distances for a typical 
reactive trajectory for the reaction catalyzed by the MAT2A enzyme.}
\label{fig:mat2a-reactive-traj}
\end{figure}
The order parameters of the system along a typical reactive trajectory is 
shown in Fig. \ref{fig:mat2a-reactive-traj}.

Committor analysis and committor distribution analysis are used to deduce 
the transition states and the reaction coordinates, respectively. 
Committor analysis is carried out for a reactive trajectory 
from the TPS ensemble by choosing a time slice randomly from the trajectory, assigning
momenta picked at random from the Boltzmann distribution for all the atoms, and running 
dynamics for $250\;fs$. The commitment probability of a time slice is calculated by 
repeating this procedure several times and finding the fraction of trajectories that go 
to the reactant, product or neither. The transition state for the reaction is defined as 
the structure from the time slice that has equal probability to commit to the reactant 
and the product state. Repeating this process for several trajectories from the TPS
ensemble results in a collection of transition states called the separatrix. 
The reaction coordinate might contain not just the atoms from the molecules that 
are directly involved in the reaction but also residues from side chains that can 
promote the reaction. Taking this into account the committor distribution analysis
starts by constraining the residues and molecules that are hypothesized to be part of the 
reaction coordinate and using this constrained system as the starting point 
trajectories are launched assigning momenta at random from the Boltzmann distribution at 
$300\;\text{K}$.

The transition state structure follows a S$_{\text{N}}2$ 
mechanism with a product like structure, the O$-$C bond is cleaved and 
has a value of $2.32$ {\AA}.
Experimentally the transition state structures of enzymatic reactions
can be elucidated using kinetic isotope effects (KIE). \cite{Schramm99MetEnzym308p301}

From the committor distribution analysis for a reactive trajectory we see that the 
constrained region consisting of just the QM part which is the ATP and MET molecules 
along with two Mg$^{2+}$ ions results in a distribution that is not peaked 
at 0.5 whereas when the residues ... are constrained we obtain a distribution 
that is peaked at 0.5. Therefore we conclude that the reaction coordinate consists
of these residues as well.

From our TPS based calculations we calculated the free energy barrier to be 
$16\;\text{Kcal mol}^{-1}$.
The activation energy of this reaction was experimentally measured by 
Niland et al. \cite{Niland21Biochem60p791} where they measured the rate 
constant of the reaction at various temperatures while keeping the 
substrate concentrations near saturation. Using the Arrhenius equation 
they estimated the activation energy to be $17.27\;\pm\;1.5\;
\text{Kcal mol}^{-1}$. Compared to typical enzyme catalyzed 
reactions calculated activation energy is small.

The equilibrated structure for the ADA enzyme complexed with adenosine, 
OH$^{-}$ anion and Zn$^{2+}$ cation is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ada-equil}.
The Zn$^{2+}$ cation interacts with the His42, His44 and His226 residues
and stabilizes the OH$^{-}$ anion in the pocket. The N1 atom on the adensoyl 
molecule hydrogen bonds with the carboxylic acid hydrogen atom of the Glu229 
residue.

The deamination is an aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction 
where intermediate Meisenheimer complex is formed at the transition state
as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ada-trans}. 
The approaching O atom of the hydroxide anion is at a distance of $1.48$ {\AA}
from the C6 atom whereas the N atom of the amine leaving group is at $1.60$ {\AA}.
The N$1-$H bond distance is $1.1\;${\AA} 
suggesting that the proton transfer from the Glu229 residue is almost complete.

$72\%$ identity with the $pv$ADA enzyme that we study here. The frequency of the

\section{Conclusions}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
In this study, we presented an application of the TPS method for the calculation 
of free energy profiles of enzymatic reactions. The order parameter along which the 
free energy profile is to be obtained is partitioned into windows similar to 
umbrella sampling. But instead of using bias potentials to sample the configurations
within the windows the shooting algorithm is used to
obtain an ensemble of trajectories according to the Monte carlo algorithm. A 
trajectory is accepted if it visits the window at least in one of the time steps. 
Using this ensemble of trajectories unbiased equilibrium probability distribution 
function of the order parameter of the reaction within each window is obtained.
Furthermore the free energy as a function of the order parameter is computed within 
each of the windows and the entirte profile is obtained by shifting the free energies
such that the function is continuous at the boundaries.   

The MAT2A enzymatic reaction was analyzed in detail to elucidate the transition state,
reaction coordinate and the free energy profile. The reaction proceeds through a 
S$_\text{N}$2 mechanism, the d$_{\text{OC}}$ and d$_{\text{SC}}$ are $2.1$ {\AA}
and $2.3$ {\AA}, respectively. The reaction coordinate is determined to involve  
the Gln113, Ser114, Arg249 and Arg264 residues. 
The free energy barrier for this reaction was calculated to be 
$16.0\;\text{Kcal}\;\text{mol}^{-1}$ which is in good agreement 
with the experimentally measured activation energy of $17.27\;\pm\;1.5\;\text{Kcal mol}^{-1}$. 
Furthermore the reaction catalyzed by the $pv$ADA enzyme is analyzed in detail to obtain the  
transition state and calculate the free energy profile.
The transition state has a Meisenheimer complex like structure with the 
d$_\text{NC}$ and d$_\text{OC}$ being $1.60$ {\AA} and $1.48$ {\AA}, respectively.
The free energy barrier for this reaction for found to be $23\;\text{Kcal}\;\text{mol}^{-1}$
with a double well shape similar to that measured from experiments.
